### Overview
This is a web application that allows the user to play two different versions of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Using 5 weeks of learnings encompassing HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I was able to accomplish all functionalities without bugs and build a user-friendly, interactive experience.

### Installation Steps
1. Fork this repo to create your own copy.
2. Clone your newly-forked repo. Make sure SSH is selected.
3. Type `cd rock-paper-scissors` to move into the root directory.
4. Use a text editor of your choice to make changes to the file.
5. See you changes in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal.

### Technologies
**HTML | CSS | Javascript**

 - Upon page load, the user is presented with two options, mild and spicy, which represent the two variations of the game.
 - Depending on which version the user selects, they will be able to choose from an array of "fighters". When the user selects one of the choices, the computer generates a randomized choice.
 - These two choices are compared to determine if there is a winner or if it is a draw. If the round has a winner, the score is tallied on either side of the game board.
 - While playing either version of the game, the user can select the change game button and return to the home screen. The score will not change if they toggle between games.

this is a quick demo of the above functionalities.

### Application Forecast
In the future, I am looking to add the following features:

1. Add an additional **extra spicy** version of the game.
2. Create functionality to allow customized usernames.
